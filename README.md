# üçï FoodVision Mini ‚Äî PyTorch Implementation

> **EfficientNetB2-based image classifier trained on 20% of the FoodVision dataset to distinguish between pizza, steak, and sushi using PyTorch.**

An image classification project built with **PyTorch**, designed to distinguish between **pizza**, **steak**, and **sushi** images using an **EfficientNetB2** architecture.  
Only **20% of the original FoodVision dataset** was used to train this compact yet effective model.

## üß† Overview

This project demonstrates how a small subset of data can still yield strong results when combined with efficient architectures.  
The model is lightweight, quick to train, and performs well on limited data.

### Key Features
- Implemented entirely with **PyTorch**
- 3-class classification: üçï **Pizza**, ü•© **Steak**, üç£ **Sushi**
- Uses **EfficientNetB2** as the feature extractor
- Trained on only **20%** of the FoodVision dataset
- Includes scripts for training, validation, and inference
- Ready for deployment or further fine-tuning

## üß© Requirements

Install dependencies before running the project:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install tqdm
pip install torchinfo
pip install pillow
```
